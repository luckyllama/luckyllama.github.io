I am a web developer in Seattle. I specialize in front-end work (javascript, jQuery, html5, and css). I have experience in html5 video, 
webgl, kinect for windows, css3 animations, node.js, coffeescript, sass/less/stylus css, and whatever other new web technology I can get my 
hands on. For backend systems, I generally stick with javascript or c#.
